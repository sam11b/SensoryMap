# SensoryMap
Sensory Map is an application made for autistic individuals or individuals with sensativities to certain external stimuli. Sensory Map provides a list of locations with reviews based on their sensory characteristics (sight, smell, etc). Users can contribute to the database (https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/project/sensorymap-72b99/overview) by adding their own reviews. Users can also share this information with their friends. 

Sensory Map: find your sensory bliss!
